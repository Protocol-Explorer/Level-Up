1. DeFi Fundamentals: Begin your journey in the readings directory. Here, you'll lay the groundwork by understanding the core concepts of DeFi lending.

2. Syntax: Next, head to the syntax directory to refine your Solidity programming skills. This section is crucial for building a strong coding foundation.

3. Assignment: Finally, advance to the Assignment directory. You can put your knowledge to the test by creating and deploying your own DeFi lending contract with Foundry.

### Navigating Each Section
In each section, you will find instructions on how to tackle that particular activity.

1. For DeFi Fundamentals: start reading (this is to provide you context and general knowledge on defi lending)
2. Syntax: This will provide you with all of the syntax needed to create this contract and will link to relevant Cyffrin lectures
3. Contracts: You will find detailed instructions inside every contract's directory on creating the contract for that particular level. This is where we get hands-on with building the defi lending contract in various levels of difficulty

## Challenge Levels

### Level 1: Mastering the Basics in Lending

#### ðŸ“š Directory: `Readings`
**Objective**: Dive deep into the world of DeFi lending. Here, you'll grasp the core concepts that form the backbone of decentralized lending platforms.
- Explore how DeFi lending works, understand key terms, and learn about the mechanics behind it.
- Inside this directory, you'll find comprehensive materials that cover everything from interest rates to risk management in DeFi lending.

#### ðŸ’» Directory: `Syntax`
**Objective**: Hone your Solidity skills. Solidity is the language of Ethereum, and mastering its syntax is key to building robust smart contracts.
- Brush up on your Solidity syntax and learn about state variables, functions, mappings, and more.
- We've packed this folder with exercises and examples that will sharpen your coding skills. 

#### ðŸ”§ Directory: `Assignment`
**Objective**: Put theory into practice. It's time to get your hands dirty and build your Basic Lending Contract using Foundry!
- You'll start from scratch, and by the end, you'll have a working DeFi lending smart contract.
- Follow the instructions within the directory to set up your environment, write your contract, and test it to perfection.

## How to Succeed in This Challenge ðŸŒŸ

1. **Start with Understanding**: Grasping the fundamentals of DeFi lending is crucial. Don't rush through this part; the knowledge you gain here will be the foundation of everything you build.

2. **Practice Makes Perfect**: Solidity might be new to you, or you may need a refresher. Either way, practice diligently. Try out the different syntaxes, and don't be afraid to experiment.

3. **Learn by Doing**: There's no better way to learn than by getting your hands dirty. Building a contract from scratch will solidify your understanding and give you practical experience.

4. **Seek Help When Needed**: Stuck? That's completely okay! Reach out in the telegram group or refer to the `defi_fundamentals` and `syntax` directories.

5. **Enjoy the Process**: Remember, learning something new is always a journey. Enjoy each step, celebrate your progress, and keep pushing forward.

## Conclusion

This challenge isn't just about learning; it's about transforming yourself into a confident participant in the DeFi space. By the end of this challenge, you'll not only have a deeper understanding of DeFi lending but also hands-on experience in building a DeFi lending contract. So, are you ready to take on this challenge and emerge as a DeFi aficionado? Let's do this! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ

Remember, the journey is as rewarding as the destination. Embrace the challenge, and let's revolutionize the world of finance together! ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¼ðŸ“ˆ
