## Basic Lending Contract Practice Repository
You've understood the fundamentals, covered the syntax. 
Now you need to practise your Foundry Skills and then build the contract.

** *Remember, this is not a course* **

If you feel like you need to revisit some Solidity Fundamentals, go to the Cyfrin Solidity Fundamental's course.

In the final assignment, we will guide you through the process of understanding and building a Basic Lending smart contract using Foundry. 
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer in the world of Ethereum and smart contracts, this repository offers a structured path to enhance your skills.

<!-- **First we focus on exercises in Foundry(CLICK BELOW TO START)**

## Repository Structure
<!-- ![Contracts Structure](contracts.png "Contracts Structure") -->

The repository is organized into 2 main directories:

1. **Final Assignment**: This is where you'll start a Foundry project from scratch and build the Basic Lending contract. There is a `Foundry-Exercise.md` if you need help setting up your Foundry project.

2. **Assignment-Hint**: Stuck or need some guidance? This folder contains hints to help you build your contract effectively.


## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1: Final Assignment
- **Objective**: Start building your Basic Lending contract.
- **Action**: Head over to the `Final Assignment` directory. Here, you'll initiate a Foundry project and begin coding your smart contract. This is your opportunity to apply what you've learned and construct the Basic Lending contract from the ground up.

### Step 2: Assignment-Hint
- **Objective**: Seek assistance if you encounter challenges.
- **Action**: If you find yourself needing a bit of help or a nudge in the right direction, the `Assignment-Hint` folder is your go-to resource. It contains useful hints that can guide you through complex parts of the contract development.

## Conclusion

This practice repository offers a comprehensive learning experience for anyone interested in smart contract development, particularly in building and testing a Basic Lending contract. By following these steps, you'll gain hands-on experience with Foundry, contract development, and testing in the Ethereum ecosystem. Happy coding!
