## What is DeFi?
DeFi, short for decentralized finance, is a rapidly evolving ecosystem of financial applications built on blockchain technology. It aims to create a more open, accessible, and transparent financial system by removing the need for traditional intermediaries like banks and other financial institutions.

## DeFi Principles
For a protocol to be considered a DeFi application, it should upload the values listed below.

- Decentralized: DeFi applications are built on public blockchains, which means any single entity does not control them. This makes them resistant to censorship and fraud.
- Permissionless: Anyone with an internet connection can participate in DeFi, regardless of location or financial status. This contrasts with traditional financial systems, which often restrict who can participate.
- Transparent: All transactions on DeFi applications are recorded on a public blockchain, which makes them transparent and tamper-proof. This helps to build trust between participants in the system.
- Automated: DeFi applications use smart contracts, self-executing contracts that can be used to automate a wide range of financial transactions. This can help to reduce costs and increase efficiency.

## Types of Protocols
From its early days, several DeFi primitives have come to dominate the landscape and represent huge amounts of onchain activity and Total Value Locked (TVL) for chains and protocols alike.  These can be broadly summarized as

- Decentralized exchanges (DEXs): These allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for a central intermediary.
- Lending and borrowing platforms: These allow users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, with interest rates determined by market demand. [Lending and Borrowing in DeFi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTp9er6S73M) - Finematics (Video)
- Stablecoins: These cryptocurrencies are pegged to the value of a fiat currency, such as the US dollar. This makes them a more stable alternative to other cryptocurrencies.
- Prediction markets: These allow users to bet on the outcome of real-world events. [What are Decentralized Prediction Markets and How Do They Work?](https://www.antiersolutions.com/what-are-decentralized-prediction-markets-and-how-do-they-work/) - Antier
