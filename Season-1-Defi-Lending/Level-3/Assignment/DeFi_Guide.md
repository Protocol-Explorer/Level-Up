Collateralized borrowing and liquidation are fundamental mechanisms in DeFi lending protocols that allow users to borrow ERC-20 tokens while mitigating risks for both borrowers and lenders. Here are some great resources to get you started.

## Collateralized Borrowing

- Concept: Users deposit a specific amount of ERC-20 tokens (collateral) into a lending pool. They can then borrow against this collateral, typically up to a certain loan-to-value (LTV) ratio (e.g., 80% of the collateral value).
- Benefits: Collateral reduces risk for lenders, ensuring repayment even if the borrowed token's price falls. For borrowers, it provides access to capital without selling their holdings.
- Interest Rates: Interest rates on collateralized loans are usually lower than uncollateralized loans due to the reduced risk.

## Liquidation

- Triggering Event: If the value of the borrower's collateral falls below a predefined threshold (liquidation threshold), the lending protocol automatically liquidates their position.

- Liquidation Process: A portion of the collateral is sold to cover the outstanding loan, along with any accrued interest and liquidation fees. The remaining collateral is returned to the borrower. 
- Consequences: Liquidation can be a harsh process, leading to significant losses for borrowers if their collateral price drops rapidly. [How to Avoid Liquidation in DeFi Borrowing](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidation)

## Understanding the Risks:

- Price Volatility: ERC-20 tokens are subject to high price fluctuations, making collateralized borrowing risky. A sudden price drop can trigger liquidation and lead to substantial losses.
- Liquidation Fees: Lending protocols charge fees for liquidating positions to incentivize market participants to maintain liquidity and stability. These fees can further exacerbate losses for borrowers.
- Smart Contract Risks: Exploits or bugs in smart contracts governing the lending protocol can lead to unintended liquidations or loss of funds.

Remember, thorough research and risk assessment are crucial before engaging in any collateralized borrowing or lending activities. Carefully review the terms and conditions of each lending protocol, including liquidation thresholds and fees, to make informed decisions.
