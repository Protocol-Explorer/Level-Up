# Smart Contract Development: Level 3 - Collateralized Lending Contract

Welcome to Level 3 of your Smart Contract Development journey! After mastering ERC20 token lending and borrowing in Level 2, you're now ready to tackle the more advanced concept of collateralized lending. This level will challenge you to integrate collateral management into your smart contracts, a key component in many DeFi applications. Are you prepared to take your blockchain development skills to new heights? Let's jump in!

## Objective

Your goal in Level 3 is to create a Collateralized Lending Contract on Ethereum. This contract will enable you to understand and implement the mechanisms of securing loans with digital assets, a fundamental aspect of many DeFi platforms.

## The Essence of the Collateralized Lending Contract

The Collateralized Lending Contract is designed to handle more complex interactions involving collateral management. This includes accepting collateral, tracking loan-to-value ratios, and handling liquidations. Here's an overview of the key functionalities:

1. **Accepting Collateral: Securing Loans**
   - **Functionality:** The `depositCollateral()` function.
   - **How it Works:** Users deposit ERC20 tokens as collateral for borrowing other assets. The contract tracks each user's collateral balance.

2. **Issuing Loans: Leveraging Collateral**
   - **Functionality:** The `borrowAsset(uint256 amount)` function.
   - **How it Works:** Users can borrow assets against their collateral. The contract ensures the loan-to-value ratio is maintained.

3. **Repaying Loans: Releasing Collateral**
   - **Functionality:** The `repayLoan(uint256 amount)` function.
   - **How it Works:** Users repay their loans to release or reduce their collateral.

4. **Handling Liquidations: Protecting the System**
   - **Functionality:** The `liquidateCollateral(address borrower)` function.
   - **How it Works:** If a borrower's collateral value falls below a certain threshold, the contract allows liquidation of the collateral to cover the loan.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
- **Prepare Your Workspace**: Create a new folder named `lending_level3`.
- **Initialize a New Project**: Start with a fresh setup using `forge init`.

### Step 2: Write the Contract
- **Collateral Management**: Implement functions to handle collateral deposits and liquidations.
- **Loan Issuance and Repayment**: Create functions for borrowing against collateral and repaying loans.
- **Liquidation Logic**: Develop logic for liquidating undercollateralized positions.

### Step 3: Compile
- **Ensure Accuracy**: Compile your contract and rectify any errors.

### Step 4: Deploy and Interact
- **Deployment**: Deploy your contract to the Scroll Sepolia network.
- **Verification**: Verify your contract to ensure transparency.
- **Interaction**: Test the collateral deposit, loan issuance, repayment, and liquidation functions on Scrollscan.

## Final Thoughts

This level is not just a coding task; it's an exploration into the complex mechanisms of DeFi and secured lending. Every line of code you write is a step towards becoming a proficient blockchain developer.

Once you've successfully deployed your contract, take a moment to celebrate. You've now completed Level 3, a significant achievement in your journey as a smart contract developer.
