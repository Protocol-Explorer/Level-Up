# Smart Contract Development: Level 4 - Advanced Lending Contract

Welcome to Level 4 of your Smart Contract Development journey! Building upon your experience with collateralized lending in Level 3, you're now set to tackle the complexities of Advanced Lending. This level introduces sophisticated concepts like Chainlink price feeds and advanced liquidation mechanisms. Are you ready to delve deeper into the world of DeFi lending? Let's embark on this advanced journey!

## Objective

Your mission in Level 4 is to create an Advanced Lending Contract on Ethereum. This contract integrates external price feeds for accurate collateral valuation and incorporates complex liquidation logic, elevating your DeFi lending expertise to new heights.

## The Essence of the Advanced Lending Contract

The Advanced Lending Contract is a step up in complexity, introducing critical functionalities such as real-time price feeds and robust liquidation strategies. Key components include:

1. **Depositing Tokens and Managing Collateral**
   - **Functionality:** `depositToken(uint256 amount)`
   - **How it Works:** Users deposit tokens, with collateral valuation based on real-time price feeds from Chainlink.
   - **Events:** `Deposited` event logged upon successful deposit.

2. **Borrowing with Collateral**
   - **Functionality:** `borrowTokenWithCollateral(uint256 tokenAmount)`
   - **How it Works:** Users borrow tokens against their collateral, determined by the latest market prices from Chainlink.
   - **Events:** `Borrowed` event logged upon successful borrowing.

3. **Repaying Loans and Handling Liquidations**
   - **Functionality:** `repayToken(uint256 tokenAmount)` and `liquidate(address borrower, uint256 tokenAmount)`
   - **How it Works:** Users repay loans or face liquidation if collateral value falls below a certain threshold.
   - **Events:** `Repaid` and `Liquidated` events logged for repayments and liquidations, respectively.

## Handling Errors and Integrating Chainlink

- **Custom Errors:** The contract includes custom errors like `InsufficientCollateral`, `TransferFailed`, and `InvalidPriceFeed`, enhancing clarity and gas efficiency.
- **Chainlink Integration:** The contract utilizes Chainlink's AggregatorV3Interface for reliable, real-time price feeds, crucial for accurate collateral valuation.

## Instructions
