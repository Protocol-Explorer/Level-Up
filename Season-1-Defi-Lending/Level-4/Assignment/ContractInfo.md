# Navigating the Advanced Lending Contract: Integrating Chainlink Price Feeds and Enhanced Functionality

## Introduction

The `Advanced Lending` contract represents a significant evolution in decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contract development. Building upon the foundational concepts of token lending and borrowing, this contract introduces Chainlink price feeds for collateral valuation, custom error handling, and detailed event logging. These enhancements provide a more robust, secure, and transparent lending platform.

## The Lender's Journey: Depositing and Withdrawing Tokens

### 1. Depositing Tokens
- **Functionality:** The `depositToken(uint256 amount)` function.
- **Process:** Lenders deposit ERC20 tokens into the contract, which are recorded in `tokenBalances`.
- **Event:** `Deposited` event logs the deposit action, enhancing transparency.

### 2. Withdrawing Tokens
- **Functionality:** The `withdrawToken(uint256 amount)` function.
- **Error Handling:** Uses `TransferFailed` error for failed withdrawals.
- **Event:** `Withdrawn` event logs successful withdrawals.

## The Borrower's Experience: Borrowing with Collateral

### 1. Borrowing Tokens with Collateral
- **Functionality:** The `borrowTokenWithCollateral(uint256 tokenAmount)` function.
- **Chainlink Integration:** Utilizes Chainlink price feeds to determine the required ETH collateral.
- **Collateral Factor:** Collateral is calculated based on the `COLLATERAL_FACTOR` and the token's current value in ETH.
- **Error Handling:** Employs `InsufficientCollateral` and `InsufficientTokensInContract` errors for respective scenarios.
- **Event:** `Borrowed` event logs the borrowing action along with collateral details.

## Liquidation Process

### 1. Liquidation Mechanics
- **Functionality:** The `liquidate(address borrower, uint256 tokenAmount)` function.
- **Process:** Allows liquidation of under-collateralized positions, transferring tokens to the liquidator.
- **Error Handling:** Uses `CannotLiquidate` error for invalid liquidation attempts.
- **Event:** `Liquidated` event logs the liquidation details.

## Role of Contract's Token Balance and Collateral

- **Token Balance:** The contract's token balance is crucial for ensuring sufficient liquidity for borrowing.
- **Collateral Management:** Collateral balances are managed for each borrower, ensuring loan security. The integration of Chainlink price feeds for real-time valuation of collateral is a significant upgrade, offering more accurate and market-reflective valuations.

## New Errors and Events

- **Custom Errors:** The contract introduces custom errors like `InsufficientCollateral`, `CannotLiquidate`, and `TransferFailed`, providing clearer feedback on transaction failures.
- **Detailed Events:** Events such as `Deposited`, `Withdrawn`, `Borrowed`, and `Liquidated` offer detailed transaction logs, enhancing the contract's transparency and auditability.

## Conclusion

The `AdvancedLending` contract marks a leap forward in DeFi smart contract design. By leveraging Chainlink price feeds, it offers a more dynamic and market-aligned approach to collateralized lending. The addition of custom errors and detailed events further strengthens its reliability and user-friendliness. This contract not only provides a secure platform for lending and borrowing but also serves as a blueprint for future advancements in smart contract development.
