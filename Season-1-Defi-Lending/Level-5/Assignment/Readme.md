## Elite-Level Lending Contract Practice Repository
You've conquered the fundamentals and honed your advanced syntax skills. 
Now, it's time to challenge your Foundry expertise with an elite-level contract.

** *Remember, this is not a course* **

If you need a refresher on advanced Solidity concepts, consider revisiting the Cyfrin Solidity Advanced course.

In this final assignment, we'll guide you through the intricate process of understanding and constructing an Elite-Level Lending smart contract using Foundry. This repository is designed for both seasoned and aspiring developers in Ethereum and smart contracts, offering a structured approach to mastering the pinnacle of development skills.
