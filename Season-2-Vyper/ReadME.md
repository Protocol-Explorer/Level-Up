# Welcome to Mission 2 - Hands on Vyper! ðŸš€

Alright this is for my Pythonista's. 
You might not be familiar with it, but today there is a full Pythonic stack for smart contract development with Vyper, Ape and web3.py!

In this mission we're going to build Vyper contracts, deploy them with Ape and interact with them using Web3.py.

The cool thing is that it's Python everywhere. Just like how with Foundry it's solidity everywhere. 
Which means that the developer experience is super nice ðŸ˜Ž

This mission is meant for developers who haven't touched Vyper yet. It's a great mission for folks who want to get started with smart contract development, especially Pythonista's.

## The Mission Structure
Each Level has the following structure:

1. **Guide**
2. **Assignment**

The `Guide` contains the necessary learning resources and information to tackle the assignemnt. You will find resources on Vyper, Ape and web3.  
The `Assignment` contains instructions for you to build the contract and get **Hands-on**.

At each level, you'll tackle these areas with increasing complexity and depth. Letâ€™s break it down:

### Level 1: Basic Contract ðŸš€
We're going to start nice and smooth focusing on `Variables`, `Functions`, `Arrays` and `Hashmaps`. Next to that we're going to cover setting up our dev environment and how interacting with a smart contract works. This might seem boring, but it's important you cover these fundamentals in order to get ready for the fun stuff in the next Level!  

### Level 2: Create Pokemons 
...  

### Level 3: Pokemon-battles!? ðŸ’ª
...  

### Level 4: Winning Prizes with Pokemon Battles ðŸŒŸ
...  

### Level 5: The End Game ðŸ¤¯
...  
## Conclusion

As you progress through each level, enjoy the process, learn from the challenges, and donâ€™t hesitate to seek help when needed. Good luck, and letâ€™s level up together!
