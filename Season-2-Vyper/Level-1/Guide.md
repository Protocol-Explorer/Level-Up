# Guide to Level 1

Let's get you equiped. This guide will go over setting up your dev environment, Vyper basics and using web3.py.
There's one thing we won't be covering, which is installing Python. If you haven't installed Python on your machine, make sure to do that!

## Anvil
Ape can use Anvil(a local blockchain) for testing. In order to make use of it, you need to install foundry. If you haven't done that, follow the instructions [over here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

## Ape

OK. If you're completely new, check out [this article](https://www.razacodes.com/blog/vyper-intro) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZvbrB1t2LQ).

These resources will help you setup Ape, including custom deploy scripts.
## Vyper

The syntax you will need for this assignment is limited to:
1. Variables
2. Functions
3. Arrays
4. Hashmaps

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_O-eSx2Udw&list=PL_qZhs4wgnWMpea0JT4TvoWMCmc4ecsKp) a playlist for you to go over the syntax.
